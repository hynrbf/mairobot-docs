# Mai Robot Overview

Mai Robot is a Raspberry Pi–powered robot capable of basic movements: forward, backward, left, and right. You control it in Python via the WheelController.

## Capabilities

- Move forward by N millimeters: await WheelController.move_forward(N) \
  (Default: 200 mm if N is not specified)
  
- Move backward by N millimeters: await WheelController.move_backward(N) \
  (Default: 200 mm if N is not specified)

- Turn left by N degrees: await WheelController.left_turn(N) \
  (Default: 90° if N is not specified)

- Turn right by N degrees: await WheelController.right_turn(N) \
  (Default: 90° if N is not specified)

When Mai robot is asked beyond the basic movements it will just respond 'I am not able to do that now.'.

Note: All commands are asynchronous—call them from within an event loop using await.
